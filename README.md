# Password Generator

## Description

Password security is very important. There are 3 major guidelines when creating and using passwords. 

1. Never reuse a password multiple times for multiple accounts. 
2. Never compose a password from personal information (birthday, spouse name etc.)
3. Never use a single character type. Utilize letters, numbers and special characters.

With this project I created a simple random password generator. This application allows users to pick from different character types lower case, upper case, numerical, and special characters. You can also choose the length of the password from 8 to 128 characters. 

Navigate through the user prompts to choose your password length and selecting characters which to include.

If an invalid length is selected you will be alerted.

If no characters are selected you will also be alerted.

After successfully choosing a correct length and atleast one character type, the result is a random generated password.
